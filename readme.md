# code_hunt rewrite branch
In this branch, the whole project is being completely rewritten from scratch

## How's the progress?
Currently I am prioritizing redoing the frontend before making the backend. Still has a working web server, just no
database it interfaces with. All html files are working Jinja templates, just with example data.

## What needs to be done?
You can check on what needs to be done in the projects tab on the github page. I will add more tasks under the todo
board as I understand what needs to be done.
