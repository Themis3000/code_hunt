# Behind the scenes
- When visiting /scan for the first time a user id is stored as a cookie in the browser
- Mongodb is used to store code data, user data, and type data
- Qr codes are generated with an api call at /api/create
# Api access
Want to start a this game in your school/public place? Contact me for api access and instructions on how to get started

Requirements for api access:
1. You must have a public space that it would be ok and not completely wasteful to hang up a bunch of qr codes
2. The people at said public place must be immature enough to want to compete
3. You must have your own strange thing/meme that isn't gnomes that you print out along with the qr code
4. You must have a method of mass producing prints in a not completely wasteful way (for example, a receipt printer)
